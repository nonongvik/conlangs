VIK: What do you know about the Xoqolat conlang?

Xoqolat is an experimental conlang that draws from several languages and philosophies. It blends elements from languages such as Basque, Lojban, Spanish, Interlingua, and others. One of its key features is omnipredicativity, which allows any noun or verb to serve as a complete sentence, much like Classical Nahuatl. For instance, "Flor" in Xoqolat can mean "It is a flower," streamlining communication by eliminating the need for explicit copulas.

The language also incorporates unique phonological rules. For example, stress always falls on the last syllable in "Blue" words (those with Interlingua and Romance influences), and vowels preceding certain consonants become nasalized. Xoqolat further distinguishes between different types of words, such as "Blue" (Romance-derived) and "Purple" (Lojban-derived), which adhere to different phonological patterns.

Xoqolat is still under development, with efforts focused on refining its grammar, vocabulary, and integration of various linguistic elements. This process includes resolving inconsistencies between its influences and ensuring its usability as a conlang for both practical and creative purposes.

Some consonant behavior also shifts, like the 's' between vowels becoming /z/, while double "ss" remains /s/​(
